# ShellCheck AI

**An intelligent, AI-powered security scanner for shell scripts.**

ShellCheck AI is a modern web application designed to help developers, system administrators, and security professionals identify potential security vulnerabilities and dangerous patterns in shell scripts before they are executed. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini generative AI model, this tool provides a detailed analysis, risk scoring, and a "Bill of Materials" for any script you provide.

The goal is to make script analysis accessible and insightful, allowing you to understand the risks associated with a script without ever running it on your machine.

## How It Works

1.  **Input a Script**: Paste your shell script content directly into the text area or provide a URL to a remote script.
2.  **AI-Powered Analysis**: The application securely sends the script to a backend powered by Google's Gemini model. The AI analyzes the script for security risks, including command injection, insecure dependencies, and privilege escalation patterns.
3.  **Receive a Detailed Report**: Within seconds, you get a comprehensive report that includes:
    *   An overall **Risk Score** (1-10).
    *   A concise **Summary** of the key findings.
    *   A detailed **Bill of Materials** listing all detected remote scripts and external binaries.
    *   An in-depth **Analysis** explaining each vulnerability, its location, and suggestions for remediation.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Security Analysis**: Uses advanced generative AI to detect a wide range of security issues, from simple mistakes to complex vulnerabilities.
*   **Remote Script Fetching**: Can analyze scripts directly from a URL, resolving and examining their content in a secure environment.
*   **Dependency and Binary Detection**: Automatically identifies remote scripts that are sourced or executed (`curl | bash`) and lists all external binaries used, providing a clear "Bill of Materials."
*   **Known Script Verification**: Compares the cryptographic hash of fetched remote scripts against a database of known, trusted scripts to identify potential supply chain attacks.
*   **Interactive UI**: A clean, responsive, and easy-to-use interface built with modern web technologies.
*   **Community Feedback**: Allows users to rate the accuracy of an analysis and provide feedback, creating a loop for continuous improvement.

## Disclaimer

ShellCheck AI is a powerful tool designed to assist with security analysis, but it is not a substitute for a thorough manual code review by a qualified security professional. The analysis is generated by an AI model and may contain inaccuracies or miss certain vulnerabilities. Always exercise caution and perform due diligence before executing any unfamiliar shell script.
