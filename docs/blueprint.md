# **App Name**: ShellCheck AI

## Core Features:

- Script Upload: Allow users to upload shell scripts for analysis.
- Pattern Detection: AI tool that will detect potentially dangerous code patterns (e.g., command injection vulnerabilities, insecure file handling, privilege escalation attempts) without executing the script. Uses a set of predefined rules and machine learning models to identify threats.
- Risk Assessment: Assign a risk score based on the number and severity of the detected issues.
- Detailed Report: Provide a report outlining the identified issues, their locations in the code, and suggestions for remediation.
- Community Feedback: Allow users to submit feedback on the accuracy of the tool and contribute to improving the detection models. This tool provides more diverse risk patterns.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Midnight blue (#2C3E50) to convey security and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F3F4), a muted and desaturated tone of the primary.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), drawing focus to critical results.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a modern, clear interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospace font for displaying shell scripts.
- Use minimalist icons representing security, risks, and file operations.
- Subtle animations when uploading, analyzing, and generating reports to enhance UX.
